## üîß Environment-Specific Variables

### Production Variables
```hcl
# High-performance configuration
vm_cpus = 4
vm_memory = 8192
vm_disk_size = 60

# Production network settings
gateway = "192.168.1.1"
dns_servers = ["192.168.1.225", "8.8.4.4"]

# Production security
vm_folder = "production"
```

### Development Variables
```hcl
# Resource-efficient configuration
vm_cpus = 2
vm_memory = 4096
vm_disk_size = 40

# Development network settings
gateway = "192.168.1.1"
dns_servers = ["192.168.1.225", "8.8.4.4"]

# Development settings
vm_folder = "development"
```

### Staging Variables
```hcl
# Production-like but smaller
vm_cpus = 2
vm_memory = 4096
vm_disk_size = 40

# Staging network settings
gateway = "192.168.1.1"
dns_servers = ["192.168.1.225", "8.8.4.4"]

# Staging settings
vm_folder = "staging"
```

## üöÄ Deployment Workflows

### Development Workflow
```bash
cd environments/dev
terraform plan    # Review changes
terraform apply   # Deploy to dev
# Test features
terraform destroy # Clean up when done
```

### Staging Workflow
```bash
cd environments/staging
terraform plan    # Review changes
terraform apply   # Deploy to staging
# Run UAT and performance tests
# Keep running for extended testing
```

### Production Workflow
```bash
cd environments/prod
terraform plan    # Careful review
terraform apply   # Deploy to production
# Monitor and validate
# Never destroy without backup
```

## üîÑ Environment Promotion

### Code Promotion Path
```
Developer ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production

2. **Staging**: Integration and performance testing
3. **Production**: Live deployment

### Checklist for Promotion
- [ ] All tests pass in current environment
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

## üìä Resource Allocation

### Production Resources
- **Total CPUs**: 12 (4 √ó 3 VMs)
- **Total Memory**: 24GB (8GB √ó 3 VMs)
- **Total Storage**: 180GB (60GB √ó 3 VMs)

### Development Resources
- **Total CPUs**: 4 (2 √ó 2 VMs)
- **Total Memory**: 8GB (4GB √ó 2 VMs)
- **Total Storage**: 80GB (40GB √ó 2 VMs)

### Staging Resources
- **Total CPUs**: 4 (2 √ó 2 VMs)

- **Total Storage**: 80GB (40GB √ó 2 VMs)

## üîí Security Configurations

### Production Security
- SELinux disabled for development workloads
- Firewalld disabled for simplified networking
- SSH key authentication
- Regular security updates
- Audit logging enabled

### Development Security
- Relaxed security for debugging
- Root access available
- Development tools installed
- Debug logging enabled

### Staging Security
- Production-like security
- Limited access
- Testing-specific configurations
- Performance monitoring

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
Add more VMs by increasing `vm_count` and adding IP addresses:

```hcl
vm_count = 4
vm_ips = [
  "192.168.10.141",
  "192.168.10.142", 
  "192.168.10.145",
  "192.168.10.146"  # New VM
]
```

### Vertical Scaling
Increase resources per VM:

```hcl
vm_cpus = 6      # Increase from 4
vm_memory = 16384 # Increase from 8192
vm_disk_size = 100 # Increase from 60
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Environment Isolation
- Use separate IP ranges
- Different domain names
- Isolated VM folders
- Separate resource pools

### Resource Management
- Right-size resources for use case
- Monitor resource utilization
- Plan for growth
- Regular cleanup of unused resources

### Configuration Management
- Keep environment configs in sync
- Use variables for differences
- Document all customizations
- Version control all changes

---

**üìù Notes:**
- All environments use the same modules for consistency
- Only variables change between environments
- This ensures testing in dev/staging reflects production
- Resource requirements can be adjusted based on workload needs
